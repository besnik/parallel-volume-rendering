Parallel Volume Rendering
=========================

Overview and detailed dicussion about parallel volume rendering on a cluster. We describe algorithms, optimalization techniques and challenges for real time rendering of big data on high performance clusters.

The documentation is based on Master Thesis from Slavomir Hudak - Visualization of Volume Data from Confocal Microscopy. Although the name contains "Confocal Microscopy" terms, the ideas, algorithms and techniques applies for any volue data (e.g. from medical MRI, CT, geological, military, syntetic physic simulation data) we want to render on a parallel archtecture
